# SIMMHT — Simulation of Magnetic Hyperthermia in Tumors (2D Bioheat)



**SIMMHT** is a numerical solver for **magnetic nanoparticle-induced hyperthermia** in biological tissue, based on the **Pennes bioheat equation** with an **internal magnetic heat source** driven by nanoparticle relaxation losses. The code targets **parametric studies** and **dataset generation** for inverse problems, optimization, and machine learning (ML) applications in hyperthermia planning.

## ✏️ Governing Equation

The solver advances the Pennes bioheat equation in 2D:
$$
\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
= \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T)
+ \omega \rho_b c_b (T_b - T)
+ Q_{\text{ext}}
+ Q_{\text{mag}}(t,T)
$$

- **Perfusion** follows a temperature-dependent law (distinct for tumor and healthy tissue).
- **Magnetic source** $Q_{\text{mag}}$ comes from the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility, $\chi''$, computed by an internal routine (`imag`) using an RK4 integration of the relaxation model.

### Key Routines (inside `functions.f90`)

| Routine | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mesh()` | Build structured Cartesian grid. |
| `id_vector()` | Tag tumor vs healthy tissue (circular mask). |
| `perfusao_sanguinea()` | Update perfusion `W(T)` per-node (different laws per region). |
| `solucao_explicita()` | Explicit (forward Euler) time-advance of the bioheat equation. |
| `aplicar_contornos_explicito()` | Zero-flux Neumann boundary conditions. |
| `imag()` | Compute \(\chi''\) for magnetic source via RK4 relaxation model. |
| `compute_metrics()` | Post-processing: min/max/avg/std temperature in tumor, mean SAR (W/kg), affected radius/area in healthy tissue. |
| `main()` | Multi-run logic: reads sweep, advances in time, writes `outputs.dat`. |

## 🔧 Build

### Using the provided makefile (recommended)

```bash
make
```

### Directly with `gfortran`

```bash
gfortran -O3 -fopenmp -march=native -funroll-loops   -o simmht variables.f90 input.f90 functions.f90 simmht.f90
```

> Dependencies: `gfortran` (Fortran 2008+), a POSIX-like shell for the makefile. OpenMP is optional (can be disabled by removing `-fopenmp`).

## ▶️ Running

SIMMHT supports **sweep mode**: each simulation in the batch uses a set of parameters that can be automatically generated by a single execution. Typical workflow:

1. Configure the **domain and tissue properties** in `config.dat`.
2. Compile using make;  
4. Run the solver:
   ```bash
   ./simmht
   ```
5. Inspect the generated **dataset** in `outputs.dat`.

### Output: `outputs.dat` columns

The solver automatically writes outputs.dat, containing per-simulation metrics:
```
"SIMULATION","PHI","H","W","PARTICLE_RADIUS","TC","S_TIME","TMIN","TAVG","TSTD","SAR","R_AFET"

```

- **TC**: steady-state temperature at tumor center (or snapshot value if early stop criterion is met).
- **S_TIME**: time to steady-state (or time at early stop).
- **TMIN/TAVG/TSTD**: spatial statistics across tumor nodes.
- **SAR**: magnetic source converted to W/kg (mean value in tumor under homogeneous conditions).
- **R_AFET**: affected radius in healthy tissue where $T > T_\mathrm{ini} + 1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.

## 📊 Intended Use

- Parametric and sensitivity analysis of magnetic hyperthermia.
- Dataset generation for **Machine Learning** (surrogates, inverse problems, optimization).
- Rapid evaluation of **therapeutic metrics**: intratumoral heating vs healthy-tissue exposure.
- Baseline for further model upgrades (implicit schemes, anisotropy, spatially varying properties).
